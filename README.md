Spaceship Game. In this project I built a small game. We can create, generate new spaceships - 3 types randomly given, and moving them on screen with the arrows. 
Made with instantiation.
By click we can create the spaceship, always the last will move, or by click the current spaceship.
I used HTML5, CSS3 and modern JavaScript for creating the functionality, and for styling. 


Technologies: HTML5 CSS3 JavaScript
